  ```
2. `cd` into your project and register hooks and install them. this may take a while.
  ```cmd
  $ pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t pre-push

    pre-commit installed at .git\hooks\pre-commit
    pre-commit installed at .git\hooks\pre-push
  ```
3. Test the pre-push hook.
  ```cmd
  $ pre-commit run poetry-hook-latest --all-files --hook-stage pre-push

    poetry-hook-latest.......................................................Failed
    - hook id: poetry-hook-latest
    - exit code: 1

    pytest-cov 5.0.0 6.0.0 Pytest plugin for measuring coverage.
  ```
4. Test the pre-commit hooks.
  ```cmd
  $ pre-commit run poetry-hook-sync --all-files

    poetry-hook-sync.........................................................Failed
    - hook id: poetry-hook-sync
    - exit code: 1
